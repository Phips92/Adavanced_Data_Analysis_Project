# Project Plan for Emotion Analysis Project with ChatGPT

## 1. Project Setup
- []  Set up conda environment
- [x] Initialize Git repository
- [x] Set up virtual environment
- [x] Create empty .py files for structure
- [x] Initial commit to GitHub https://github.com/Phips92/Adavanced_Data_Analysis_Project

## 2. Data Preprocessing
- [ ] Create dataset with 5000 entries from ChatGPT
- [x] Preprocess data (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)
- [x] Save preprocessed data for future steps
- [x] Implement Bag-of-Words vectorization
- [x] Implement TF-IDF vectorization
- [ ] Compare results of BoW and TF-IDF to choose between them

## 3. Feature Extraction
- [ ] Implement LSA to capture relationships between terms and documents (using SVD)
- [ ] Implementing LDA 
- [ ] Save the created topic vectors to train models

## 4. Model Training
- [ ] Implement Logistic Regression model
- [ ] Implement Random Forest model
- [ ] Implement other models (SVM, Naive Bayes, GBM)
- [ ] Train these models on saved lsa/lda vectors
- [ ] Cross-validation

## 5. Evaluation & Comparison
- [ ] Implement evaluation metrics (Accuracy, F1-Score, Classification Report)
- [ ] Compare performance of different models
- [ ] Compare LSA vs. LDA topic vectors for training
- [ ] Document results

## 6. Final Steps
- [ ] Optimize model (hyperparameter tuning)
- [ ] Model interpretation using SHAP or LIME ?
- [ ] Summarize findings in a report
- [ ] Final commit and push to GitHub
- [ ] 1/2 DIN A4 page with explanation of the procedure (+link of the GitHub repo)
